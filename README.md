# TicTacToe3.0

Ended up needing a few extra weeks as life got busy. Ultimately ended up with zero global code but still speghetti. My original tic tac toe had 
a score feature but you couldn't add your own names. Also had global scope code and no factory functions.

Overall this was a mess and I spent longer then I needed to on it. 

Forgot to code in a draw state, other versions had it.
